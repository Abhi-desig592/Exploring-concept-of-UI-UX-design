        "-Clarifies Ideas and Concepts: Wireframes translate abstract ideas into concrete visuals, providing a clear understanding of how different elements will interact on a page. Designers can focus on content placement, navigation, and functionality without being distracted by colors, typography, or detailed visuals. This helps in laying out the structure and flow of the user experience (UX) without getting caught up in the aesthetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Facilitates Collaboration: Wireframes serve as a communication tool between designers, stakeholders, developers, and clients. They are easy to understand and allow for early-stage feedback, ensuring that everyone is on the same page before moving forward. This helps prevent miscommunication and costly changes later in the design.\n",
